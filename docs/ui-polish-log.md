# UI polish log (branch `ui-polish`, from 11/4 until the feature freeze on 11/6)

Two aims (Kento): a first-time visitor knows what to read and what to press, and the screens stop looking like a generic
AI-made page. The direction is a merchant's ledger:
- sections divided by ruled lines and space;
- Mincho headings with readable body text;
- vermilion only for the master's marks;
- ink, indigo, vermilion and paper colours.

Screenshots before and after each change are in `docs/screens/ui-polish/` (`before/` is the starting point). A screen-only
critic (`.claude/agents/ui-critic.md`) reviews them after each change.

## 帳場

1. **Ledger sections.** The card is read in order, so each part became a section with a margin label: 場面 → 段取り → そのほか
   → 判定 (vertical on wide screens, horizontal on phones). 表の連絡・裏の一言・時期 are larger under 段取り, with one line
   saying the judgment is made here and what 表／裏 mean. The rest is quieter under そのほか.
   *Why:* every row looked equally important, and newcomers did not know where to look.
2. **The marks are a seal.**
   - Before choosing, they are faint. The chosen one gets a double vermilion frame like a seal's rim, full ink, and a slight
     tilt with a short press.
   - Keys 1・2・3 press ○・△・× (not while typing; the hint shows on wide screens only).
   *Why:* the three tiles looked like ordinary buttons, already stamped before anything was chosen.
3. **"What just happened" without the side panel.** The previous-judgment line now also says what the apprentice is doing with
   it (reading it, written to the 心得帳, nothing changed for a ○) and is announced politely to screen readers.
4. **Vermilion only for the master.** The "needs the master" notice moved to ink, and the empty-state ○ in the side panel became
   a plain sentence.
5. **Small:**
   - The disabled submit button now has a border and readable text (it was about 2:1).
   - The Next.js dev badge is off in development.

## 最初の画面

1. **What it is, in three ruled lines** (一・二・三, a real sequence): the apprentice drafts, the master only stamps, and the
   corrections stay with their why and pass to the successor. The paragraph above them is shorter.
   *Why:* the old paragraph had to be read to the end to learn what happens.
2. **Two ways to start, as a ruled list.** Each button gets one line on who it is for: 「まず全体を見るなら」 against
   「心得帳は空から、あなたの印だけで」.
   *Why:* the two side-by-side boxes were a stock landing-page pattern, and the difference between them was unclear.
3. **One real 心得 as a specimen.** It comes from the demo's 心得帳: 浜風運輸, the master's × and words, the why from 2019, the
   date. *Why:* the product's output was invisible until after a click.
4. **Data handling folded below** (content unchanged). The fictional-data line at the bottom was dropped, since the banner
   already says it. On phones the headline is a little smaller, so 「作法を、」 stays on one line.

## 帳場（2回目、ui-critic の講評から）

1. **The three 段取り lines are tighter**, and 表の連絡／裏の一言 carry a small gloss under the label (窓口へ正式に／決裁者などへ
   根回し) instead of a paragraph. *Why:* the marks were far below the fold, and the explanation was a manual to read.
2. **Ink before the seal.** Unpressed marks are drawn in ink; vermilion appears only on the one the master presses. The record
   button is indigo, so it no longer outweighs the seal. The key numbers show on wide screens only.
3. **Plain wording after judging:** 「…に △を記録しました。このデモでは、弟子の読み取りは行いません（公開版のライブでは
   行います）」, with no 記録済み／ライブ版 jargon.
4. **Tap targets:** 「ここで区切る」 and 「取り消す」 are 40 px tall. On phones the status line is shorter.
5. **Kept: the indigo tab in the navigation.** It is a 暖簾 hanging from the top rule, tied to 「暖簾を継ぐ」, and its dark-mode
   contrast is about 8:1.
6. **Tried and reverted:** そのほか in two columns squeezed 伝え方 into a narrow strip.

## 心得帳

1. **The 沿革 is visible without a click.** Under each 心得: the date, the master's mark in vermilion and words, the scene, and
   「わけ」. An earlier wording appears as 「前は ~~…~~」. *Why:* the history is the point of the 心得帳, and every entry hid it
   behind 「出典と沿革」.
2. **The master's 心得 lead.** The 「師匠」 tag pill is gone (the section says so). A 心得 that started as a ledger fact carries a
   short note instead. The 台帳 facts are folded at the bottom, with their count.
3. **Quieter structure.** Client headings use a thin rule instead of a heavy one. The full source list and 「消す」 share one small
   fold per entry, and 「消す」 is in ink, not vermilion.
