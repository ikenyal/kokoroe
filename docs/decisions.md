# Decision records / 決定記録

Format: ID · date · status · decision · why · alternatives considered.

## D-001 · 2026-11-03 · Accepted · Stack
TypeScript (strict) + Next.js App Router + Tailwind, `@anthropic-ai/sdk`, Vitest, tsx, npm. Hosting on AWS Amplify (from 11/6).
**Why:** one language for UI, API routes, eval scripts and spikes; one person, one week.
**Alternatives:** Python backend + separate frontend (two toolchains, slower).

## D-002 · 2026-11-03 · Provisional · Fast apprentice vs. slow compiler
Apprentice drafts and successor Q&A use the **Messages API** (Sonnet 5.5, seconds). Interpreting corrections and compiling the
kokoroe-chō use **Managed Agents** with a memory store (Opus 5.5, async).
**Why:** the master's 1-tap ○/△/× flow can't wait on a long-running session; compilation is async and benefits from a persisted,
versioned store. **To verify:** session latency in today's spike.
**Alternative:** Messages API only (simpler, but loses the persisted, auditable memory store) — kept as the fallback.

## D-003 · 2026-11-03 · Accepted · No MCP tools during development
A PreToolUse hook (`mcp__.*`) blocks every MCP call in this repo.
**Why:** the developer's Claude Code has work-related MCP connectors; this repo is public and hackathon materials are not confidential.
A rule in CLAUDE.md alone can be forgotten; a hook can't.
**Note:** an MCP server *as a product feature* is a separate decision, to be discussed before building.

## D-004 · 2026-11-03 · Accepted · Machine-checkable master simulator
The simulator judges proposals with code predicates over structured fields (channel, recipients front/back, timing, follow-up,
format, posture tags, escalation flag), not with an LLM grader. LLM is used at most for phrasing the master's one-liner.
**Why:** LLM graders are lenient, especially when grader and apprentice share a model family. Numbers must be reproducible.

## D-005 · 2026-11-03 · Accepted · Hidden rules are committed but isolated
`data/hidden/rules.json` is in the repo (reproducible eval) but only `eval/simulator/` may read it. A test fails if `src/` or `app/`
references `data/hidden`.
**Why:** reproducibility for judges + honest Before/After.

## D-006 · 2026-11-03 · Accepted · npm with pinned versions
Exact versions in `package.json` and a committed `package-lock.json`.
**Why:** judges' Quickstart (`npm install` → run) must not break when upstream releases change after submission.

## D-007 · 2026-11-03 · Accepted · Secret scanning without external tools
`scripts/check-secrets.sh` (staged-diff regex + env-file block) runs from `.githooks/pre-commit` and from a Claude Code hook
before `git commit`.
**Why:** gitleaks isn't installed; a tiny script covers the realistic risks (Anthropic/AWS keys, `.env.local`) with zero setup.
